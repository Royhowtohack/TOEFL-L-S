### Listening Scripts 

#### Conversation 1 Philosophy

Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.

Student: So the reason I came in, Professor Williams, well, it’s about what you were explaining in your philosophy class today.

Professor: Yes?

Student: En, Yeah, the whole thing about simulations, would you …would you mind going over that with me again?

Professor: No problem. The main point of the book I was referring to is that, well, in a post-modern world, we live in a world of unreal images of simulations. For example, the things we see on TV become a reality for us even though they are not in fact real. They’re representations, simulations of reality.

Student: Post-modern world?

Professor: Right. It came after the modern one.

Student: Gee...thanks a lot.

Professor: No, sorry. You are right. Post-modern, well, that’s a sticky term that covers a lot of things. Let’s save that for later. But back to my point about simulation, it leads to hyper-realism, a feeling that something is more real than real.

Student: Wow…Wow, I’m sorry. But all this is…I just don’t get it.

Professor: Video games, virtual reality, theme parks, all of these remove us from reality. Worse yet, we can begin to think these simulations, these fake experiences are real, or we don’t know the difference anymore.

Student: Well, actually I’m starting to think this class is not for me. In fact, I wonder if I might not do better just to drop the course. 

Professor: Oh, you are still having trouble following this?

Student: Yeah, I just don’t think I’m cut out for philosophy. I signed up because my academic advisor…well, I feel like my advisor sort of pushed me into it.

Professor: I see. If I may ask, what are you interested in?

Student: I want to be a lawyer.

Professor: Well, then you need a firm base in logic and argumentation, so this philosophy course is basically a necessity for you.

Student: I hope not. I could only get maybe half the lecture.

Professor: That’s pretty good then. I covered a lot, probably too much. And these were only some opening remarks for the first day of class. I was just skimming through some contemporary ideas and, well, more cultural theory than actual philosophy, so you needn’t worry. Starting next week, we are going to read some real philosophy, primary sources like Plato, Rousseau, Emerson. And you’ll be able to talk about them in small discussion groups led by graduate assistants. 

Student: Well, I don’t know.

Professor: I understand you are uneasy about this course, but, well, give it another chance, attend a few more sessions, get into your assigned discussion group, then see how you feel. Look, these ideas, like what post-modernism really is. They are ideas that people developed over years, careers, lifetimes. I didn’t mean to scare you.

Student: I guess I should have just taken it in the spirit it’s intended, as an intro. You are right that instead of trying to wrap my mind around every little detail all at once, I need to work on seeing the bigger picture and not getting so stressed out. 

Professor: Well, don’t think you are going to learn all the law right away either. Have you looked at the law library lately?

Student: Yeah. Talk about scary!

#### Conversation 2 Car Parking

Listen to a conversation between a student and a university employee.

Student: Hi. I had a question. I normally park my car in the lot next to the music building. 

Employee: Oh, okay. Lot 7.

Student: Yeah. Yeah, I never had a problem using that lot before…

Employee: Is it about us closing the lot this Friday? We had students complaining, but I can give you a pass to Lot 10. You know about the orchestra festival in the music building that day, right?

Student: Right. I knew about that. My question is actually about…well, you know, while I’m here I guess I will need a pass but the fact is I’m in the orchestra festival myself. I play the cello. So maybe…

Employee: Sorry. On Friday that lot is non-university guests, so you’ll have to…

Student: Go to Lot 10. You sure? I’m in the orchestra.

Employee: Sorry.

Student: Okay. That’s fine. I guess I’ll need a pass, but anyway, I got a parking ticket yesterday.

Employee: Okay. Do you want to pay your fine now? You have two weeks to pay it.

Student: I don’t. Actually I don’t understand why I got it. I always park in the same lot. I mean, I didn’t do anything different.

Employee: Okay. Is there a code number on the ticket? I can look it up.

Student: Yeah. I remember it. It says 036.

Employee: Alright, let me check. This was yesterday?

Student: Yeah, early afternoon it would have been.

Employee: Okay. Violation 0-3-6. It says here parking in more than one space. Do you have a big car or something? I know we repainted the lines closer together so we could fit more cars in the lot.

Student: No, it’s a small car.

Employee: Well, you must have parked over the line. More than one parking spot.

Student: Really? I’m sure I wasn’t.

Employee: We have forms to contest the ticket. Do you want one? If you don’t think you did anything wrong, you can fill it out here. Let me get you one.

Student: Even though it will probably be a great waste of time…

Employee: Okay. And you wanted that pass to Lot 10, right?

Student: Oh, yeah, right, I forgot about that.

#### Lecture 1 Landscape Architecture

Listen to part of a lecture in an architectural history class.

Professor: Now we’ve talked about how social concerns inform the designs of some architects in the United States in the 19th century. And it holds true not only for building architects but also for landscape architects. The way we design our landscapes is hugely important to, for how we live, easily as important as the buildings we live in. And these social concerns were especially apparent in the work of a huge figure in the history of landscape architecture: Frederick Law Olmsted.

Olmsted is particularly associated with the building of public parks in the mid-1800s. At that time, with industrialization, the United States was moving from a rural, agricultural way of life to an urban one. Many people were moving from farms to cities, and cities themselves were growing fast. And that was creating concern and anxiety about people losing touch with nature.

Now, based on your reading, how did this situation relate to Olmsted? Ken.

Male Student: Well, he saw that as cities grew to accommodate the larger populations, a lot of open space would be used up for buildings and infrastructure. I guess he thought that eventually there might not be any open space left, green space.

Professor: And others shared this concern as well, people with some power.

Male Student: Right. So in New York City, they decided to build this huge park, Central Park. And they hired him to design it.

Professor: Right. Olmsted together with Calbert Vaux. And he, what Olmsted wanted to do through this park and others was to preserve people’s connections with the natural world. Central Park is his best-known project and it really launched his career. There were so many details that made this such a model of success that…yeah, Julia.

Female Student: It seems like he integrated the park into the city really well, especially by putting streets across the park so that you can still get from one side of the city to the other.

Professor: And those streets don’t disrupt the unity of the park very much. But why not? What feature, what modification did he make?

Female Student: Well, they weren’t any narrower than any regular city streets.

Professor: No, not narrower.

Female Student: Oh, lower. He put them at a lower level than the rest of the park and used short tunnels.

Professor: Yes, exactly. The streets were designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, not interrupting the flow of people walking in the park, not interfering with the natural setting, while still functioning as streets.

Making tunnels was the best way to achieve this balance in many locations within the park, and then pass for pedestrians went above the street throughout the park.

What’s so special about it to me is Olmsted did such a good job of using the space by emphasizing the natural elements of the park. So with ground areas that were low, he made them even lower and turned them into ponds and meadows, then he emphasized some high, rocky areas. He used…he planted small forests close to grassy meadows. By doing this, he emphasized contrast in contour and texture, but he made it all work as a whole. He also made the northern half of the park more of the nature preserve while the southern part was more for people and recreation.

So Central Park was a huge success and it led to more work for him. He designed dozens of urban parks throughout the country. So that’s probably his greatest legacy to architecture as a profession, but not his only legacy.

He also designed landscapes for public buildings, campuses, even entire towns. In that area, urban planning, he showed the same concern for preserving open spaces that he had shown with Central Park. For example, his design of a town of Riverside, Illinois. He planned it so it would have the conveniences of city living, but it also had open space for recreation for nature. He lowered the streets slightly so they wouldn’t block natural views, like views of the Des Plaines River, which flows through Riverside. He really wanted to preserve the shores of the river so he didn’t put houses there. Instead, he turned the river front area into a park. And about a quarter of Riverside is parks.

What’s also remarkable is that Riverside, well, even today, the streets and other parts of Olmsted’s plans are almost completely intact. It’s really an oasis in the city that’s grown around it, the city of Chicago, since that time. Goes to show you how valuable good design really is.
